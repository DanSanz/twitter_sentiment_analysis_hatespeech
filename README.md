# Twitter sentiment analysis to detect hate speech
![Everyone Likes a Pairplot](figures/seaborn-pairplot-3.png)
Different tweets from two sources were grouped in order to build a larger collection of roughly 50000 tweets contaning positive, neutral and offensive language. Offensive language is also divided into simple offensive language and hate speech.
Hate speech's definition is taken from Cambridge Dictionary: "public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation". The main goal of this project is to build a model capable of identfying and differianting hate speech on Twitter. In the final section winning model runs across fresh tweets collected daily from Twitter API in the UK, showing percentage of overall tweets labelled as positive, neutral, offensive language or hate speech.

Promptly identifying hate speech and overall offensive language is a very important concern for all major social media platforms. According to the public order act from 1986, any communication which is threatening or abusive, and is intended to harass, alarm, or distress someone is forbidden. The penalties for hate speech include fines, imprisonment, or both. It is very important to ensure social platform media only act as a medium of spreading free speech and constructive ideas. One of the main challenges when it comes to hate speech detection is also to differentiate it from any other type of offensive language.

The final dashboard showcasing percentage of language tone on Twitter can be found here on Heroku. Fresh tweets are pulled every 24 hours.

> We suggest that people follow a "Facebook Page" approach to writing up their README. This means that the most important information is at the top (your name, point of project, contact info) and then as you go down the document you get less and less relevant information. Remember that you are NOT writing a detective story and need to find a way to present as much information as quickly as possible to the person that will be looking at this for 45 seconds tops. Of course others might look for longer, but the UX/UI of your REAMDE should be done with the 'github skimmer' in mind.

### Executive Summary

Start with one or two sentences here that contextualises what your project matters here.
These two sentences will demonstrate your business understanding. 

Next, in a second paragraph, write how you were able to make a data science operationalization of the problem.
For example, you might say that in order to help solve this problem you set out to build a classification ML model in order to automate some process. 

Third, you then write what you did on the project that is a bit more technical.
Here you might say that you took data from [here and make it a link to the original data]() and then ran `a list of models you ran here` in your analysis.
Then end with one sentence that picks what your best model was and how it performed.

Lastly, you say in one or two sentences why this matters. 
For example, now as opposed to before this data analysis, you can now predict X better than Y. 

The goal of this project was to create a `regression/classification` model that was able to predict `what you set out to do`.

> If you are able to swap out the text here with what your case example is you will demonstrate the following:
> 1. You get why what you're doing 'matters'
> 2. You are able to take ill defined problems and turn them into something a data scienst can solve
> 3. You show off your analystical and modeling chops.
> 4. You are able to communicate technical things you do.

### More Information

Below your Executive Summary, you can document whatever you feel would be of interest to a future employer.
Here I would especially suggest diving a bit deeper into your methodology and including images that you are proud of from the project. 
Remember, that people will probably judge your github project page within 45 seconds tops, you want it to look as clean as possible. 

Write documentation that looks like someone you would want to work with.
